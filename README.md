Repo for RSS resources for my site


This repo serves as the dump for resources related to my research website. Currently focues on RSS aggregation of security headlines, CVEs, and other vulnerability related information. 

I have no background in programming or computer science, so the code found here may be partially or entirely generated by LLMs, and troubleshooted by me as necessary. Fork if you dare.
